# LANGSTER

## PROJECT PROPOSAL:
LANGSTER â€“ A Front-End Language Learning App
Langster, an engaging front-end web application built entirely with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Langster aims to provide users with an immersive language learning experience, supporting English, French and regional Indian languages. The app will feature lessons, video-based tutorials, voice pronunciation support, responsive UI.  This project will serve as a complete demonstration of our front-end capabilities and UX design proficiency.

## UI-UX ANALYSIS: 

As part of the initial phase of the LANGSTER project, we conducted a focused UI/UX analysis by a G-Form survey among group of language learners. This survey aimed to extract valuable user insights regarding preferred learning methods and language preferences. Based on the collected data, we identified key expectations such as video-based learning, voice pronunciation assistance, addition of regional languages. These insights directly reflected in the creation of our user flow and wireframes, which were designed using Figma. This research-driven approach ensures our website remains user-centric, aligned with real user needs.

## COMPETITOR ANALYSIS :
Popular platforms like Duolingo, Tandem, and Speakly have dominated the language learning world with advanced AI tools and premium-only content. Duolingo offers gamified learning but locks key features behind a paid version. Tandem and Speakly also provide more effective learning paths through their premium versions.  Langster, on the other hand, is a completely free platform, focused on  simplicity. It currently supports four languages-English, French, Telugu, and Tamil as structured modules from basic to advanced, ending with a graded quiz. Rather than competing, we view these platforms as inspirations, shaping our mission to make language learning inclusive and approachable for all.
## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
## FUTURE SCOPE:

## CONCLUSION:
Langster is built with the goal of making language learning simple, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone. By focusing on structured content and user-friendly design, it offers a practical path for learners at all levels. This project reflects our vision to support meaningful communication through free, inclusive language education.
